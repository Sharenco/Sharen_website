<!--
I'll add it here because i see already a lot of Git clones, this website won't add much, all the stuff you see and hear are from me, by me, or for me.

If you clone it, please use it to your own usage or delete everything that are in Media folder, they are my property.

Uploading a website that use my assets will be sued if you do not have my approval.

I'm also using some JavaScript and will surely make it into it's own file to not have to make <scrips> inside HTML.

I really don't see why people clone this tho, it's some boring guy's boring webpage...

                        <p>Jeremy Willis, hailing from Boston, Massachusetts, is the sprightly offensive class of the team. With unmatched speed and agility, he navigates the battlefield with acrobatic grace through his double jump. His youthful bravado makes him both an asset and a liability. Always bold, often reckless!</p>
